                Many individuals face significant challenges in selecting and caring for plants suitable for their
                specific environmental conditions. Home gardeners often lack access to tailored information, leading to
                difficulties in achieving optimal growth and resulting in plant wilting or failure. Similarly, farmers
                struggle to choose the most appropriate crops for their fields, which can negatively impact agricultural
                productivity and sustainability.

                These issues are exacerbated by a lack of localized, accurate information about weather patterns and
                environmental factors that influence plant health. The absence of comprehensive tools that provide
                personalized plant recommendations based on real-time weather data creates a gap in support for both
                amateur
                gardeners and professional farmers.

                Additionally, there is a notable scarcity of user-friendly applications in Turkey that combine these
                elements into
                a cohesive platform. This lack of resources results in missed opportunities for individuals to enhance
                their
                gardening experiences and for farmers to improve crop yields. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an
                integrated solution that can assist users in selecting the right plants, provide care instructions, and
                support
                sustainable agricultural practices. ECOBLOOM aims to address these challenges by leveraging technology
                to
                create a holistic platform for plant selection and care.
