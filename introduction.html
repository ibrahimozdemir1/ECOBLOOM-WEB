                ECOBLOOM is a web-based application designed to assist users in selecting and maintaining plants that
                thrive
                in their specific environmental conditions. ECOBLOOM aims to provide plant enthusiasts, gardeners, and
                farmers with personalized, data-driven recommendations and care guidance to ensure optimal plant growth.

                Many individuals face challenges in growing and caring for plants due to a lack of tailored information,
                often resulting in poor growth or wilting. Similarly, farmers struggle to select the most suitable crops
                for
                their fields, negatively impacting agricultural productivity. These problems are frequently exacerbated
                by
                limited access to accurate, localized information about environmental conditions and plant care.

                ECOBLOOM collects weather and climate data based on users' locations through an API. Using this data,
                the
                application predicts future weather and environmental conditions with machine learning algorithms.
                Finally,
                the system recommends the most suitable plants from its database for the user's specific environment.
                With
                these insights, the application offers plant suggestions tailored to each user's unique surroundings.
            </p>

                Beyond plant selection, ECOBLOOM features a chatbot that provides detailed care instructions for chosen
                plants and suggests reliable sources for purchasing them. By offering a single platform to manage the
                entire
                process plant selection, purchase, and maintenance ECOBLOOM enhances users' plant-growing experiences
                and
                contributes to more sustainable agricultural practices.

                We see that there is no comprehensive application in this area in Turkey. The ECOBLOOM project
                stands
                out from other applications in this field due to its comprehensive approach; it combines all stages of
                plant
                cultivation into a single platform and offers an interactive chatbot for user support. The system will
                be
                implemented as a web application accessible in both home gardening and agricultural settings.
