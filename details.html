            <p class="large-text"><strong>1. System Overview</strong></p>
            <p>ECOBLOOM is a web-based application developed to assist users in selecting and caring for plants that are
                suited to their specific environments, as well as support farmers in choosing appropriate crops for
                their fields. The system integrates several key components to achieve its functionality, including data
                collection via API, data analysis through machine learning, a recommendation engine, and an interactive
                chatbot. The main components of the system are as follows:</p>

            <p class="middle-text"><strong>1.1. Data Collection and Integration</strong></p>
            <p> ECOBLOOM collects real-time weather and climate data through an API based on users' geographic
                locations. This information includes variables such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and
                seasonal patterns.</p>
            <p> These data points are crucial for predicting favourable environmental conditions for different plant
                species and serve as the foundation for the recommendation engine.</p>

            <p class="middle-text"><strong>1.2. Machine Learning Prediction System</strong></p>
            <p> ECOBLOOM employs machine learning algorithms to analyse collected climate data and forecast future
                environmental conditions. By identifying patterns and trends in weather and climate, the system creates
                a database of environmental factors that influence the growth of various plant species.</p>
            <p> This predictive capability enables the application to recommend plant species that are most likely to
                thrive in specific environmental conditions.</p>

            <p class="middle-text"><strong>1.3. Plant Recommendation Engine</strong></p>
            <p> Based on the predictive insights obtained from the machine learning model, the ECOBLOOM recommendation
                engine suggests the most suitable plant species for users' locations from a pre-prepared plant database.
            </p>
            <p> The engine considers factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and seasonal changes to make
                tailored suggestions for home gardeners, plant enthusiasts, and farmers.</p>

            <p class="middle-text"><strong>1.4. Interactive Chatbot</strong></p>
            <p> To provide a more engaging user experience, ECOBLOOM includes a chatbot that interacts with users by
                answering questions about plant care and offering step-by-step guidance on nurturing their chosen
                plants.</p>
            <p> Additionally, the chatbot can simulate purchasing options, guiding users to reliable sources for
                acquiring plants and materials necessary for their growth.</p>

            <p class="middle-text"><strong>1.5. User Interface and Web-Based Access</strong></p>
            <p> The application will be accessible through a user-friendly web interface. The interface allows users to
                input their location and preferences, receive plant recommendations, and interact with the chatbot for
                continuous support.</p>
            <p> Accessibility and ease of use are central to the design, ensuring that both novice and experienced
                users can seamlessly access ECOBLOOM?s features and guidance.</p>
